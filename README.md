# Simon Game
Simon is a WebApp based on the electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. The WebApp creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.
This is another project in The Complete Web Development 2020 Bootcamp course from Angela Yu.
The WebApp focuses on implementing the popular simon game by using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap and JQuery.
The project is used to practice advanced DOM, JS, Click Events, JQuery principles and concepts.
